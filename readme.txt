uhh its got a few cool commands

half written by ai because i really dont feel like making boggle function on my own

to initialize  get node and npm and stuff and then run npm i and then npm start

if you wanna add custom cards for cah use the addwhite script like node addWhite.js "Card."

i think thats it yeah
